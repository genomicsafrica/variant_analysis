# Evaluating Read Qualities with `FastQC`

## Learning objectives
- Implement `FastQC` to evaluate read qualities

## Importance of Evaluating Read Qualities

Before engaging in any next-generation sequencing project is it best practice to inspect your sequence reads to ensure that they are of good quality. Sources of error are be numerous and include poor library construction and a malfunctioning sequencer. Therefore, it is critically important that you analyze your sequenced reads to ensure that they are high-quality before you devote time and resources to downstream analyses.
